Technical Notes
===============

This document describes additional technical information of aria2. The
expected audience is developers.

Control File (\*.aria2) Format
------------------------------

The control file uses a binary format to store progress information of
a download. Here is the diagram for each field:

.. code-block:: text

     0                   1                   2                   3

                    Repeated in (NUM IN-FLIGHT) PIECE times

``VER`` (VERSION): 2 bytes
   Should be either version 0(0x0000) or version 1(0x0001).  In
   version 1, all multi-byte integers are saved in network byte
   order(big endian).  In version 0, all multi-byte integers are saved
   in host byte order.  aria2 1.4.1 can read both versions and only
   writes a control file in version 1 format.  version 0 support will
   be disappear in the future version.

``EXT`` (EXTENSION): 4 bytes
   Reserved. This field used to hold extension flags; the LSB enabled
   the "infoHashCheck" extension, which compared the saved InfoHash
   with the current downloading one. It is not used anymore.

``INFO HASH LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of InfoHash that is located after this field. The value
   is validated and the INFO HASH field is skipped when a control file
   is read. For HTTP/FTP/SFTP and Metalink downloads, this value is 0.

``INFO HASH``: ``(INFO HASH LENGTH)`` bytes
   The info hash of the download. aria2 does not store an info hash
   anymore, so this value is empty and its length is 0.

``PIECE LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of the piece.

``TOTAL LENGTH``: 8 bytes
   The total length of the download.

``UPLOAD LENGTH``: 8 bytes
   The uploaded length in this download.

``BITFIELD LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of bitfield.

``BITFIELD``: ``(BITFIELD LENGTH)`` bytes
   This is the bitfield which represents current download progress.

``NUM IN-FLIGHT PIECE``: 4 bytes
   The number of in-flight pieces. These piece is not marked
   'downloaded' in the bitfield, but it has at least one downloaded
   chunk.

The following 4 fields are repeated in ``(NUM IN-FLIGHT PIECE)``
times.

``INDEX``: 4 bytes
   The index of the piece.

``LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of the piece.

``PIECE BITFIELD LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of bitfield of this piece.

``PIECE BITFIELD``: ``(PIECE BITFIELD LENGTH)`` bytes
   The bitfield of this piece. The each bit represents 16KiB chunk.
